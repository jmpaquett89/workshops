# Unit Test Workshop #2

This workshop focuses on writing the describe and it blocks for each test

## Objectives

1. Learn about writing unit test describe and it blocks

## Scenario

Fredward has written a list of sentences and is wanting to determine the word in each sentence has the highest word score.

Fredward has provided a rubric for how he invisions each word score is calculated and how to determine the highest scoring word.

The word score is determined by a sum of each letter's position in the alphabet. (i.e. a = 1, b = 2, z = 26)

If there are more than one word with the highest score than the first word out of them in the sentence is the defacto highest scoring word.

Fredwards list of sentences:

1. I hope that, when I’ve built up my savings, I’ll be able to travel to Mexico.
2. Wouldn’t it be lovely to enjoy a week soaking up the culture?
3. In the end, we all felt like we ate too much.
4. Sentences come in many shapes and sizes.
